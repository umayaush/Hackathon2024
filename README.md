## Steps to Load Project in Localhost Servers
1. In VS Code Terminal or any other terminal, open the "server" directory and enter the prompt "npm run dev" to run the server side<br/><br/>
2. In a new / another VS Code Terminal or any other terminal, open the "my-app" directory and enter the prompt "npm run dev" to run the client side<br/><br/>
3. You can log in to the application using the email and password provided in the placeholder text. Or you can sign up with an email and password of your choice which will be stored in the backend, allowing you to login with your own login information.<br/><br/>

npm install nodemon --save-dev<br/>
